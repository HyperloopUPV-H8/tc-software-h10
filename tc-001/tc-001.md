# Intro to programming
Programming languages live all around; they can be used in any field, and they are defined as "languages for communicating instructions to a machine" [^1].

## What is programming?

Programming is telling a computer what to do through instructions it can understand. Talking to computers in ones and zeroes is highly inefficient, so programming languages were born, replacing large structures with simpler terms and more complex and effective constructions.

### Lingo

- Syntax: rules of writing code
- Variables: data points of different types
- Functions: group of instructions
- Abstraction: generalisation of concrete details into objects and systems

### Low- and high-level programming

A low-level language provides little or no abstraction from the processor's instruction set architecture [^2] and so needs no compiler or interpreter to be executed. Conversely, a high-level language offers high abstraction over this instruction set at the cost of computing power and execution speed.

##  Hands-on demo

This simple Python snippet shows in a highly abstract way all the basic aspects of any program written in any programming language.

```python
majority_age = 18 # Variable with a simple assigned value
min_majority_year = 2024-18 # Dynamically assigned value

birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ") # User inputted variable

def check_age(birth_year): # Function
	# Conditional
	if birth_year >= min_majority_age:
		print("You are an adult!")
	else:
		years_to_majority = birth_year - min_majority_year
		print(f"You are not an adult! You have {years_to_majority} years left until majority!")
```

Python is a very abstracted language, and so it automatically does many things for the programmer, like assigning variable types and even letting the variables change type dynamically; this comes at the cost of needing an interpreter [^3], making it slower to run than other languages but not needing to be compiled [^4] like other faster languages like C, let's see the same script if we decided to write it in C:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int majority_age = 18;               // Simple assigned value
    int min_majority_year = 2024 - 18;   // Dynamically assigned value
    int birth_year;

    printf("Enter your birth year: ");
    scanf("%d", &birth_year);

    // Conditional
    if (birth_year <= min_majority_year) {
        printf("You are an adult!\n");
    } else {
        int years_to_majority = birth_year - min_majority_year ;
        printf("You are not an adult! You have %d years left until majority!\n", years_to_majority);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

C is a compiled programming language, still high-level. For a glimpse at low-level, which we won't cover in this course, let's take a look at this Assembly script for an ARM AArch-64 processor like the one in a Raspberry Pi 5.

```asm
        .section .data

prompt_msg:         .asciz "Enter your birth year: "
adult_msg:          .asciz "You are an adult!\n"
not_adult_msg:      .asciz "You are not an adult! You have %d years left until majority!\n"
input_format:       .asciz "%d"

        /* Variables */
majority_age:       .word 18
min_majority_year:  .word 2024 - 18  /* 2006 */

        .section .bss
birth_year: .space 4     /* Reserve 4 bytes for an int */

        .section .text
        .global main
        .extern printf
        .extern scanf

/* int main(void) */
main:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        /* 1) Print prompt: printf("Enter your birth year: ") */
        adrp    x0, prompt_msg              /* Load upper bits of prompt_msg */
        add     x0, x0, :lo12:prompt_msg    /* Add lower offset */
        bl      printf

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        /* 2) Read birth_year: scanf("%d", &birth_year) */
        adrp    x0, input_format
        add     x0, x0, :lo12:input_format  /* x0 = format string "%d" */

        adrp    x1, birth_year
        add     x1, x1, :lo12:birth_year    /* x1 = address of birth_year */

        bl      scanf

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        /* 3) Compare: if (birth_year >= min_majority_year) */

        /* Load birth_year into w0 and min_majority_year into w2 */
        adrp    x2, min_majority_year
        add     x2, x2, :lo12:min_majority_year
        ldr     w0, [x1]                    /* w0 = birth_year */
        ldr     w2, [x2]                    /* w2 = min_majority_year */

        cmp     w2, w0
        blt     not_adult                   /* if (birth_year > min_majority_year) => jump */

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        /* 4) If adult: printf("You are an adult!\n") */
is_adult:
        adrp    x0, adult_msg
        add     x0, x0, :lo12:adult_msg
        bl      printf
        b       end_program

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        /* 5) If not adult */
not_adult:
        /* years_to_majority = birth_year - min_majority_year */
        sub     w0, w0, w2                  /* w0 = (w0 - w2) */

        /*
         * We want: printf("You are not an adult! You have %d years left ...\n", years_to_majority)
         *   x0 = address of not_adult_msg
         *   x1 = integer value of years_to_majority
         */
        adrp    x2, not_adult_msg
        add     x2, x2, :lo12:not_adult_msg
        mov     w1, w0                      /* w1 = w0 => years_to_majority */
        mov     x0, x2                      /* x0 = address of format string */

        bl      printf

end_program:
        /* return 0 */
        mov     w0, #0
        ret
```

The value of a high-level language is clear: productivity and agility.

## JavaScript

In this course we will be using JavaScript, the program we did earlier looks like this written in it:

```js
const readline = require("readline");

// Basic variables
const majorityAge = 18;
const minMajorityYear = 2024 - majorityAge; // 2006

function checkAge(birthYear) {
  if (birthYear <= minMajorityYear) {
    console.log("You are an adult!");
  } else {
    const yearsToMajority = birthYear - minMajorityYear ;
    console.log(`You are not an adult! You have ${yearsToMajority} years left until majority!`
    );
  }
}

// Create an interface for reading input from the console
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

// Prompt the user for birth year
rl.question("Enter your birth year: ", (answer) => {
  const birthYear = parseInt(answer, 10);
  checkAge(birthYear);
  rl.close();
});
```

### Basic structures of a program

```js
// 1. Variables
let count = 3;           // Can be reassigned
const greeting = "Hello"; // Cannot be reassigned

// 2. Conditionals
if (count > 5) {
  console.log("Count is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("Count is 5 or less");
}

// 3. Loops
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  console.log(`For loop iteration: ${i}`);
}

// 4. Functions
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
console.log("3 * 4 =", multiply(3, 4));

// 5. Basic Data Structures
const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3];
const personObject = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

console.log("Array:", numbersArray);
console.log("Object:", personObject);
```

## Exercise time

> Install IDE before next steps, I suggest [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Exercise of the day

Write a simple program with various calculation functions, such as a simple calculator.

### Exercise of the week

Extend the calculator to recognize a simple input like the ones we use daily.

Ex.: "1 + 1 + 1", "2 \* 3", "2 / 4"
Extra: "(1 + 2) \* 3"
