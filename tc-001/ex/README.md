# Week 1

Create a calculator program in JavaScript, Python, C or any programming language. The program should be able to receive an input as a string and parse it, outputing the correct result in the console.

Some example inputs could be:

- "1 + 1 + 1"   // 3
- "2 \* 3"      // 0.6...
- "2 / 4"       // 0.5

An advanced exercise is proposed:

- "(1 + 2) \* 3" // 9
